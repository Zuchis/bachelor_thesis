Due to the performance difference between the microprocessors and the main memory access 
speed, many modern computer applications have been suffering with a problem known as 
the processor-memory bottleneck, in which the processor stays idle while it waits for 
data to be fetched in the memory. Graphical applications, specially electronic games, are 
notorious for suffering this kind of problem because of the huge amount of different 
elements that constitute them. This paper proposes the implementation of a game engine, 
using a code structuring concept, the data oriented design, for the purpose of reducing
this bottleneck problem caused by the constant access to the memory, written in the Rust 
programming language, a language which aims velocity and the efficient and safe use of 
the memory.
